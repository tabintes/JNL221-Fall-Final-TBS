      <h1>Exploring the fluctuation of teacher hire rates across New York counties</h1>
      <h2>From the 2021-2022 to 2022-2023 school year, New York counties reported a shift in teacher hiring trends, with some areas increasing staffing hires while others saw notable declines.</h2>

      <p>Even though teachers are the cornerstone to a child’s development, many teachers around the country have yet to receive their flowers.</p>
      <p>A study conducted by <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-for-teachers/7159">WalletHub</a> has found that in 2024, New York ranks as the top state for aspiring teachers to work in. New York ranks in the top ten for teaching opportunities, academic/work environments, as well as the highest average annual salary for public school teachers after adjusting for cost of living.</p>
      <p>Despite these claims, teachers who work in the city have seen a changing shift in the teaching industry. While the recent COVID-19 pandemic has left a mark in the industry, this shift has been noticed long before the pandemic.</p>
      <p>“Families are not as involved as they used to be and so I think the bulk of the responsibility, not just teaching, but the emotional and social aspects, has fallen on teachers. And I think with COVID, there has been a bit of that gap,” a former New York City teacher who wishes to stay anonymous, said. The teacher will be referred to as Sarah.</p>
      <p>According to the New York State Education Department, Bronx county had the second highest drop in teaching staff from the 2021-2022 to 2022-2023 school year. Sarah, who previously taught in the Bronx, was not surprised by this statistic.</p>
      <p>“I've had students tell me that I can't in any way tell them what to do because their parents have been to detention centers or prison before and so you don't want to mess with their parents. A lot of the discipline falls on the teacher,” Sarah said.</p>
      <p>Even though Sarah’s love for children and teaching younger minds is undeniable, she admits that when it comes to teaching schools in the city, things can get tough. Especially when it comes to New York’s mandated state testing, called the New York State Board of Regents, Sarah felt that teaching a rigid curriculum further adds to the stress that comes with the changing shift in New York education.</p>
      <p>“Before there was a lot more autonomy on how you could teach. But now, teachers are mandated to do things the way (school) districts require them to. There's a lot of data collection and assessments which takes the joy out of teaching on top of feeling pressurized. The kids are not one size fits all,” Sarah said.</p>

      <p>Though city school teachers find it hard for standardized tests to hold any effect on their students and their teaching styles, suburban school teacher Daniel Callahan said otherwise.</p>
      <p>“My attitude towards it has changed a lot since I got into teaching. I was initially very against it, but now I can kind of see that it does help me ensure that I'm covering certain things that the students need to be able to do,” Callahan said.</p>
      <p>Throughout his 24 years of teaching, Callahan, an English teacher at West Genesee High School in Onondaga county, who has taught in various locations throughout New York, says that he is fortunate to be teaching at West Genesee, especially when it comes to covering additional financial expenditures.</p>
      <p>“I am very, very lucky to be in the district that I'm in. I know that it's very different in the city, but I’m very privileged to have the resources that I have,” Callahan said. “The number of students who receive free and reduced price lunches has gone up a lot in the last 24 years and we have a lot of students who are in need. It's amazing to be able to see that we can provide for them.”</p>
      <p>While Onondaga county has a relatively average student-teacher ratio, West Genesee has the highest ratio in the county. Regardless, Callahan prefers teaching in larger groups with several exceptions.</p>
      <p>“You don't want a class that's too small. I've had classes that are small and when you have a few kids who are out of it, it gets tough,” Callahan said. “This year, I have three sections: two that are in the mid 20s and one that's 18. And I really like the bigger classes because there's just a lot of great discussion that goes on. But as an English teacher, grading gets difficult when you’re grading essays and projects.”</p>

      <p>Teaching conditions differ greatly when it comes to New York. While city schools come with their own set of challenges, aspiring teachers should not underestimate teaching in suburban schools.</p>
      <p>“It's a field where everyone has experience with it because we've all sat in a classroom and know what a teacher does. They have this idea of how the students are going to respond and think all the students will do their homework and are enthusiastic,” Callahan said. “But then you face the reality and you have to motivate them and know that not all of them want to be there.</p>
